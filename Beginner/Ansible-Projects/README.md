# *Ansible Master-Slave Architecture Project*
### The objective of this project is to set up an Ansible master-slave architecture on two EC2 instances, one as the master and the other as the slave, to demonstrate secure and automated management of remote servers using Ansible.

## Architecture Overview:
The project involves setting up two EC2 instances:
1. **Master Instance:** This instance will act as the Ansible control node, responsible for managing and configuring the slave instance.
2. **Slave Instance:** This instance will be managed and configured by the master instance using Ansible.

## Step-by-Step Implementation:
### Step 1: Launch EC2 Instances
- Launch two EC2 instances with the same Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and configure the necessary security groups.
- Ensure that both instances have a public IP address and can communicate with each other.
### Step 2: Generate RSA Keys
- On both instances, generate a pair of RSA keys using the ssh-keygen command.
- The generated keys will be used for secure SSH communication between the master and slave instances.
### Step 3: Configure SSH on Master Instance
- On the master instance, create a new SSH configuration file (~/.ssh/config) and add the slave instance's IP address and username.
- Copy the master instance's public RSA key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the slave instance's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys file`.
### Step 4: Configure SSH on Slave Instance
- On the slave instance, create a new SSH configuration file (~/.ssh/config) and add the master instance's IP address and username
- Ensure that the slave instance's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file contains the master instance's public RSA key.
### Step 5: Install Ansible on Master Instance
- Install Ansible on the master instance using the package manager (e.g., yum or apt).
- Configure the Ansible inventory file (/etc/ansible/hosts) to include the slave instance's IP address and username.
### Step 6: Test Ansible Connection
- Run the ansible -m ping command on the master instance to test the connection to the slave instance.
- Verify that the master instance can successfully connect to the slave instance using Ansible.
### Step 7: Create Ansible Playbook
- Create an Ansible playbook (e.g., slave_config.yml) on the master instance to configure the slave instance.
- The playbook should include tasks to manage and configure the slave instance, such as:
  - Installing software packages
  - Configuring system settings
  - Deploying applications
### Step 8: Run Ansible Playbook
- Run the Ansible playbook on the master instance using the ansibleplaybook command.
- Verify that the playbook successfully configures the slave instance according to the defined tasks.



The Ansible Master-Slave Architecture Project provides a hands-on experience in setting up and configuring an Ansible-based infrastructure on EC2 instances. This project showcases the power of Ansible in automating and managing remote servers, while ensuring secure communication and access control. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
